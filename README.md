# Welcome to make-your-CV app! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cdrrazan/make-your-cv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cdrrazan/make-your-cv)

**make-your-cv :** Get info from user and store/generate PDF!

## Setup
I already wrote a script file to automate the setup process.

1. Give permission to the file:
  **``$ chmod +x make-your-cv.sh`` or ``$ chmod 755 make-your-cv.sh``**

2. Run the file as:
**```$ ./make-your-cv.sh```**

This will check and create db and automatically start the server for you!

Don't forget to check Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml as well.
